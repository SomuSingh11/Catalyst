## Catalyst: AI-Powered Code Comprehension Suite

Catalyst is an advanced developer productivity suite designed to solve the "Codebase Understanding Problem."

Modern repositories are massive, complex, and poorly documented. Onboarding to a new codebase or debugging a legacy module often requires hours of mental mapping. Catalyst automates this by turning any GitHub repository into an interactive, queryable knowledge base.

Catalyst allows developers to ask high-level questions ("How is auth handled?") and receive accurate, context-aware answers backed by citations.

## 🚀 The Problem

Modern software engineering faces a critical bottleneck: Context Switching & Code Complexity.

- **Onboarding is slow:** Developers spend weeks just reading files to understand architecture.
- **Search is shallow:** Ctrl+F and grep only find keywords, not logic or intent.
- **Documentation is stale:** Wikis and Readmes are rarely in sync with the actual codebase.

## 💡 The Solution

Catalyst (and its core engine, GitWhiz) solves this by building a "Digital Twin" of your repository. It doesn't just read text; it understands structure.
